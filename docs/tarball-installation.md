# Tarball installation quick start

Use the Salesforce CLI to install the packaged tarball directly from GitHub releases:

```
sf plugins install https://github.com/NerioVillalobos/plugin-metadelta/releases/download/v1.0.17/metadelta-1.0.17.tgz
```

After installation, confirm that the plugin is registered:

```
sf plugins
```

The plugin should appear in the list with its current version.
